# Overview 

Ts. Abdul Alim Abdul Muttalib currently serves as the Head of Technology and Innovation at Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd (Dec 2024 – Jan 2026), where he focuses on digital transformation, blockchain, and AI within the Halal ecosystem, particularly in developing solutions that help consumers verify the Halal status of products and services.

During the session, Ts. Abdul Alim emphasized the importance of continuous exploration and self-learning, encouraging students to actively seek new knowledge beyond lectures in order to fully utilize their university years, especially in the rapidly evolving technology landscape.

This talk reinforced my belief that successful projects require proper planning, clear objectives, and collaboration. Moving forward in my computer science journey, I aim to apply these principles by planning carefully, identifying the right tools and skills, and working effectively with teammates to overcome challenges and achieve meaningful outcomes.![IMG_3891](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bfc5954-79c6-46fa-b74f-36f9a68787db)
