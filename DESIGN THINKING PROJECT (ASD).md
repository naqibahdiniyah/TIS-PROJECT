# 🧑‍💻DESIGN THINKING PROJECT (ASD) 👩‍💻
# Digital Solutions for the Autism & ADHD Community
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neuro related developmental disability due to differences in the brain. Autistic individuals often face challenges with social interaction and communication as well as restricted and repetitive behaviours of interest.
Therapy services are sometimes too far away, too expensive, long waiting list and take too much time to access. Online platforms help narrow down the gap between autism therapists and parents. However, common video conference tools rely on single camera view, which limits the therapist observation. This project aims to provide an online consultation specialized for autism therapy, integrated by multi-camera setup to improve quality of online sessions.
