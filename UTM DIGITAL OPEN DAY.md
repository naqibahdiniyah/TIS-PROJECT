# Overview 

On 29 October 2025, our group had the opportunity to visit UTM Digital during the UTM Digital Open Day, which provided us with valuable exposure to the real-world application of digital technologies and systems.

We attended an informative talk by Mr. Helmee bin Yaacob, Head of Section (Administration), Digital Division of Digital Innovation, who shared insights on “Project Management and System Development in UTM.” The session helped us better understand how project planning, teamwork, and system development are applied in a professional environment.

After the talk, we were given the opportunity to interview Mr. Helmee by asking questions related to the topic, allowing us to clarify concepts and gain deeper understanding from an industry perspective.

We also visited several exhibition booths, including Dell Technologies, where we learned about current technology solutions and innovations used to support digital transformation.
