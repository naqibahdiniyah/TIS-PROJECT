# PC Assembly and Diassembly 🖥️

Date 📆: Wednesday, 12 November  2025

Time ⏳ : 10.00 a.m.

Venue📍: N28 Faculty Computing

# Overview 

This session gave us our first in-depth exposure to the internal components of a PC, allowing us to better understand the complexity of the hardware that we use almost every day. Beyond theoretical learning, we were given the opportunity to practice the disassembly and reassembly process ourselves.

Under the guidance of our instructor and lab assistants, we followed a step-by-step procedure:

1. starting with opening the PC casing,

2. unplugging internal cables,

3. removing the power supply,

4. RAM, hard disk, and

5. finally detaching the cooling fan.

After completing the disassembly, we were required to reassemble all components correctly and test the system to ensure it functioned properly.

Overall, this practical session strengthened our understanding of computer hardware, improved our technical skills, and provided valuable hands-on experience that connects classroom knowledge with real-world applications.![Uploading IMG_8356.jpeg…]()
